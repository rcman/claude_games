I want to make a 2d scrolling platform game with a static background image in html5. I want the game to be played in 1920x1080 and have multiple platforms. These platforms contain enemies, searchable lockers and crates which the player can crouch down behind to avoid enemy bullets. The platforms scroll from right to left and the player progresses forward in the level. Enemies shoot back and have some AI intelligence. The player can pick up ammo, armour pieces and keys from the lockers. You need 10 armour pieces to upgrade your armour. Upgrading your armour lessens you damage from enemy bullets. Since the player consumes bullets when shooting, finding ammo in a locker replenishes some of it. The random keys that are found are to open special doors, but you need a few keys to unlock a door. When Opened the player gets full ammo and full armour for 60 seconds and the enemies get much harder. When this door is open the enemies Boss appears and is very difficult to kill. Once killed the level is over and the next level starts. This code  is written in HTML5
