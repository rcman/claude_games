write me a 3d game but in 2d view of a space shooting game where the ship can turn in any direction and fire a beam. This bean is filed at planets to collect different resources. These resources are iron-ore, copper-ore and zinc-ore. The gathering of these resources allow the player to craft drones which can be given a task to mine other planets. All these resources either collected by the player or drone are transferred  back to main base. This will be made in html5 and BabylonJS
