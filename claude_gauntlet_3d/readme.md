**Explanation of Major Changes and Completions:**

1.  **Physics:** `CannonJSPlugin` is added and physics impostors are created for player, enemies, walls, doors, ground, and generators. Player movement now uses `setLinearVelocity`. Enemy AI uses velocity as well.
2.  **Player Input (`handlePlayerInput`)**:
    *   Movement now uses camera-relative directions (`camForward`, `camRight`).
    *   Aiming is implemented by making the player face the mouse cursor position on the ground plane.
    *   Attack, Special, and Potion use check game time against cooldowns/availability.
3.  **Combat (`playerAttack`, `playerSpecialAttack`, `createProjectile`, `damage...` functions):**
    *   Warrior melee attack checks for enemies/generators in front and applies damage/knockback. A visual slash effect is added.
    *   Ranged attacks create projectiles using `createProjectile`.
    *   Special attacks for all classes are implemented with basic logic, damage, cooldowns, and visual effects (particles/meshes).
    *   `createProjectile` creates a sphere mesh, sets properties (speed, damage, owner), and adds it to the `projectiles` array.
    *   `damagePlayer`, `damageEnemy`, `damageGenerator` handle health reduction, sound effects, visual feedback (flashing), invulnerability frames (player), and trigger death/destruction logic.
4.  **Enemy AI (`updateEnemies`)**:
    *   Uses a simple state machine (idle, chasing, attacking).
    *   Enemies move towards the player when chasing using physics velocity.
    *   Enemies stop and attack when in range (melee or ranged via projectiles).
    *   Enemies rotate to face the player.
5.  **Projectiles (`updateProjectiles`)**:
    *   Projectiles move based on their direction and speed.
    *   Lifetime check removes old projectiles.
    *   Collision checks (`intersectsMesh`) are performed against walls, closed doors, enemies (for player projectiles), and the player (for enemy projectiles).
    *   Impact effects are created upon collision.
6.  **Items and Interactions (`checkCollisions`, `openDoor`)**:
    *   `checkCollisions` iterates through items, doors, exit key, and exit door, checking for intersection with the player mesh.
    *   Picking up items applies effects (health, score, adds keys/potions), plays sounds, shows messages, and removes the item.
    *   `openDoor` handles the logic for opening doors, including checking/using keys, playing sounds, animating the door (sliding up), and disabling collisions/physics.
    *   Exit key pickup sets the `hasExitKey` flag.
    *   Touching the exit door triggers `levelComplete` only if `hasExitKey` is true.
7.  **Generators (`updateGenerators`, `createGenerator`)**:
    *   Generators spawn enemies periodically based on `spawnRate` if the player isn't too close.
    *   They have health and can be destroyed using `damageGenerator` and `generatorDestroyed`.
    *   Health bars are added using BabylonJS GUI.
8.  **Health Bars (GUI):**
    *   BabylonJS GUI (`AdvancedDynamicTexture`) is used to create health bars directly linked to enemy and generator meshes (`linkWithMesh`).
    *   Helper functions (`createEnemyHealthBar`, `updateEnemyHealthBar`, etc.) manage their creation and updates. Player health bar uses CSS.
9.  **Game Flow (`gameOver`, `restartGame`, `levelComplete`, `loadNextLevel`)**:
    *   These functions handle transitions between game states.
    *   They show/hide the appropriate UI screens (Game Over, Level Complete).
    *   Sounds are played/stopped.
    *   `restartGame` now performs a more thorough cleanup by disposing the old scene and re-running `loadGame`.
    *   `loadNextLevel` increments the level, carries over player stats (with partial health restore), and calls `startGameLevel` to generate and set up the new level.
10. **Sound:** Placeholder comments `#` added where sound URLs should go. `Howler.js` calls are integrated for various events. `loadSounds` now uses Promises and checks for load completion/errors.
11. **Refinements:** Added particle effects for impacts, healing, spawning, destruction. Used `gameTime` based on `engine.getDeltaTime()` for smoother time-based logic. Improved visual feedback (flashing, animations). Added simple knockback.

This completed code provides a functional base for the Gauntlet 3D game. You'll need to replace the placeholder sound URLs (`#`) with actual audio file paths or URLs. Further enhancements could include more complex AI, varied enemy attacks, different weapon types, more sophisticated level generation, detailed scoring, and better animations.
