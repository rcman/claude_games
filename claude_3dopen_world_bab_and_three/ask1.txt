write me a 3d Open-world survival in HTML5 and BabylonJS. No not include any noise javascript plug-ins, or simplex-noise plug-ins. I will be using models in this game but I don't want to add them now. I want there to be fog and a day/night cycle. I do not want weather affects. The world should be varied in height and low areas should use Three.min.js Water.js for realistic water. The player should be able to harvest trees, stones, tall grass, iron-ore, zinc-ore, copper-ore and scrap metal from the map. The player should be able to hunt chicken, rabbits and deer for meat, fat, leather and feathers.  There should be random barrels on the map containing random loot.  The player spawns with an axe, pickaxe, knife and water canteen. The player can craft the following items in his inventory for use or placement in the world: Camefire (can be placed in the world) I should be able to control how many tree, stones, ore of all types, animals, grass, scrap metal, barrels spawn on the map but there should be quite a few at start.
