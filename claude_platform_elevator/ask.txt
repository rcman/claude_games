write me a 2d platform game in HTML5. The game is played in 1920x1080 and on the left and right side of the screen there are elevators which automatically move to the top and bottom on the level. The player can stand on these elevators to get to another level. The player can also shoot. There are enemies on each level, the player must collect all keys located randomly on different levels  to proceed to the next level. As you get higher in level the AI get smarter and more difficult. The player must search random lockers located on levels which contain additional ammo
