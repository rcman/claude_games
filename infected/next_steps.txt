Next Steps (If You Want to Expand):
Graphics: Replace rectangles with actual images (sprites).
Crafting: Implement a crafting system (e.g., combine wood + stone -> axe).
Building: Allow placing simple structures (walls, floors).
More Complex AI: Give enemies varied behaviors.
Sound: Add sound effects and music.
Saving/Loading: Use localStorage to save game state.
World Generation: Generate a larger, more interesting map instead of a static rectangle.
Day/Night Cycle: Implement time passing and its effects.
More Survival: Add hunger, thirst, temperature.
Tool Usage: Require specific tools (like an axe) to gather certain resources.
This example provides a fundamental structure, but building a full game like "The Infected" is a massive undertaking. Have fun experimenting with this basic version!
